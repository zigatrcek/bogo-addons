# Bogosort Odoo Addons
A collection of [Odoo](https://github.com/odoo/odoo) addons I developed for my own personal use.

## Installation
Follow [Odoo installation instructions](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/master/administration/on_premise/source.html), then add this repository into the `addons_path`. That should make all the modules visible and installable in your Odoo installation.
